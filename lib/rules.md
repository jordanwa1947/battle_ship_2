  "First enter the Coordinates for a two unit ship (example: \"A1 A2\") and
a three unit ship. Coordinates must be the first and last unit of your ship.
Ships may not overlap or bend arround the board and can only be placed
horizontally or vertically. The computer will place it's ships and prompt
you to fire. Take turns with the computer firing shots at each other's ships.

  On your turn, type a letter and a number that identifies a row and column
on your target grid (example: \"A1\"). The computer checks your coordinate
on it's ocean grid and responds \"miss\" if there is no ship there, or
\"hit\" if you have correctly guessed a space that is occupied by one of
it's ships. Each of your shots (guesses) are marked on your grid using H for
hits and M for misses. When it's the computer's turn to fire shots at your
ships, a random coordinate will be chosen. each time one of your ships
receives a hit, an H will be placed on the ship corresponding to the grid
space. When one of your ships receives a hit on each coordinate, the computer
will announce that it has sunk your battle ship and vice versa. Game play
continues until either you or the computer has sunk all of the openent's ships.

  It is, of course, illegal to change the position of the ships on the board
once play has begun. The first player to sink all five of his opponent's
ships wins the game."
